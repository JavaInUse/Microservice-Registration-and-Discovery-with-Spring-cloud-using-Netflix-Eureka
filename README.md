# Microservice-Registration-and-Discovery-with-Spring-cloud-using-Netflix-Eureka

In this series we learn how to use Netflix Spring Cloud Components. [In these posts we make use of Netflix component Eureka for service registry and discovery](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/spring_eurekaregister).

In this post we develop 2 spring boot microservices named as employee-producer and employee-consumer.
As the name suggests employee-producer will be exposing REST APIs which will be consumed by the employee-consumer.
